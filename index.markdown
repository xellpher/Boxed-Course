## What is Web Literacy?

The drive to teach coding in schools is spreading like a wildfire. In the UK primary schools have started teaching coding to children as young as 4 years, and in numerous other countries coding is a hot topic. Finland is no exception, with programmes like koodi2016 giving first indications about what life in schools will be like in two years time.

While coding is a good skill to have, it is arguably only one part of being able to take full control of the computerized world that we already live in. There are manby other skills that are just as important and, together with coding, allow someone to take control of that world. These skills together make up Web Literacy.

The aim of this course is to teach you, the teacher, the basics of the skills in Mozilla's Web Literacy Map, an effort to not only list the aforementioned skills, but to also make sense of the connections between them and create ways of understanding the skills.
